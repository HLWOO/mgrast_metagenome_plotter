#MG-RAST functional gene abundance plotting

MG-RAST is a great tool for metagenome analysis as a beginner but the amount of data can easily overwhelm basic Excel functions. To help visualize all the information, this tutorial will help a new R user plot functional gene abundances against factors in their metadata. The code provided  covers some basics of data frame manipulation and plotting using ggplot2. I recommend cloning this repository into a new Rstudio project and going through the R markdown file (metagenome_plotting_R_demo.Rmd) line by line.

Good luck!
